## Finding and Installing new plugins

## Self-contained utility setup

Use [the bundled setup instructions](references/setup.md) and [dependency manifest](dependencies.json) when this workflow needs a utility. Check availability first; the skill’s scripts install selected missing tools without relying on another skill’s setup files. Optional media, engine operations, and repository-specific toolchains are selected for the actual task. Existing session permissions and account configuration still apply.


- List plugins: `pnpm nx list`
- Install plugins `pnpm nx add <plugin>`. Example: `pnpm nx add @nx/react`.
